# The intent of this file is to list the steering committee members that
# approve changes to the repository documents. Members listed within
# STEERING-COMMITTEE.md must be marked as owners of repository documents.
#
# Note that order in this file is EXTREMELY important - the last matching
# rule will win. This means that the most general rules should be listed
# first in this file, followed by more specific rules.

# Default Owners (Steering Committee Members)
