# Charter for the MixedRealityToolkit Organization

This is the organizational charter for the MixedRealityToolkit Organization (the "Organization"). By adding their name to the [Steering Committee.md file](./STEERING-COMMITTEE.md), Steering Committee members agree as follows.

## 1. Mission

MRTK3 is the next generation of MRTK, focused using OpenXR where applicable and focusing on integration with Unity X-plat developer ecosystem.  We believe that MRTK is a strategic middleware platform to significantly reduce XR developers time to bring solutions to market.  We are looking to build a consortium of X-Plat strategic to:

* To drive adoption, promote support and development, and expand the MRTK ecosystem focused on XR developers across specific endpoints.
* Sign up strategic XR companies were the company would either be an end point device or a software development tool provider.
* Establish and document best practices for the development, design and deployment of MRTK enabled XR applications.
* Promote, document, educate and contribute into MRTK 3.
* Coordinate and collaborate with industry standards and certification.
* Establish a communication network where key parties can come together to share templates, code, practices, etc.
* Identify and market joint messaging for the MRTK ecosystem to the AR developer channel.

## 2. Steering Committee

**2.1 Purpose**. The Steering Committee will be responsible for all technical oversight, project approval and oversight, policy oversight, and trademark management for the Organization.

**2.2 Composition**. The Steering Committee voting members are listed in the steering-committee.md file in the repository.
Voting members may be added or removed by no less than 3/4 affirmative vote of the Steering Committee.
The Steering Committee will appoint a Chair responsible for organizing Steering Committee activity.

## 3. Voting

**3.1. Decision Making**. The Steering Committee will strive for all decisions to be made by consensus. While explicit agreement of the entire Steering Committee is preferred, it is not required for consensus. Rather, the Steering Committee will determine consensus based on their good faith consideration of a number of factors, including the dominant view of the Steering Committee and nature of support and objections. The Steering Committee will document evidence of consensus in accordance with these requirements. If consensus cannot be reached, the Steering Committee will make the decision by a vote.

**3.2 Voting Quorum**: A quorum must be present in order for a committee meeting to convene or for any vote to be official. A quorum consists of 1 member from each company. 

**3.3 Voting**: The Steering Committee Chair will call a vote to the Steering Committee. Any discussion may be conducted in person or electronically by text, voice, or video. The discussion will be open to the public. In any vote, each voting representative will have one vote. Except as specifically noted elsewhere in this Charter, for a vote to pass quorum, there needs to be a simple majority (50% + 1) of the total voting membership. When a vote is taken, all members who are present and entitled to vote must choose 1 of 3 options: Yes, No, or Abstain. There must be more "yes" votes than "no" votes in order for a motion to be carried. If there is a tie, the motion is not carried. 

**3.4 Proxy Vote**: In the case where a member may not be able to attend, they can elect to use a proxy vote. The person designated as a proxy will cast a proxy vote in line with the member’s directions. The proxy must attend the meeting and be an employee of the same company.

**3.5 Delaying vote**: After the discussion of a motion, if members deem that there needs to be more evaluation/amendment, then they can put forth a call to delay the vote. 

**3.5 Chairperson Voting**: Chairpersons have the same voting rights as other members and are not afforded extra rights. Chairpersons’ votes come out of those allotted to the company. 


## 4. Termination of Membership

In addition to the method set out in section 2.2, the membership of a Steering Committee member will terminate if any of the following occur:

**4.1 Resignation**. Written notice of resignation to the Steering Committee.

**4.2 Unreachable Member**. If a member is unresponsive at its listed handle for more than three months the Steering Committee may vote to remove the member.

**4.3 Affiliated Organization Revocation**. If a member lists an Affiliated Organization in the steering-committee.md file, that Affiliated Organization may remove or replace such Steering Committee member without a vote with written notice to the Steering Committee. A member so removed or replaced (for example due to change in employment status) remains eligible to be added back onto the Steering Committee as provided in section 2.2.

**4.4 Effect of Removal**. Upon the removal of a non-Sponsored Steering, that position on the Steering Committee is permanently removed. When a Sponsored Steering Committee member is removed for any reason, their position on the Steering Committee becomes vacant and may be replaced concurrently with removal or separately at a later time by the Sponsoring entity by written notice to the Steering Committee. A Sponsored seat may be permanently abandoned and be removed by written notice from the Sponsoring entity to the Steering Committee.

## 5. Trademarks

Any names, trademarks, service marks, logos, mascots, or similar indicators of source or origin and the goodwill associated with them arising out of the Organization's activities or Organization projects' activities (the "Marks"), are controlled by the Organization.

If a Steering Committee member is terminated or removed from the Steering Committee, any rights the Steering Committee member may have in the Marks revert to the Organization.
